## Portfolio Website
https://ianperalta.dev/

## Overview 

This portfolio website was built using the React and Bootstrap UI. The website has three pages: Home, Projects, and Contact. 

- Home page - overviews my skills and experience including a brief bio and some links to other pages and social media profile.

- Projects page - showcases a sample full-stack projects I've built. A project in Java/Bootstrap and a project in NodeJs/Express/React. Each project includes a short description, a demo link, and links to the source code.

- Contact page - allowing visitors to contact me through email. 

Other links on the footer of this portfolio website will go to my LinkedIn and internal pages. Overall, the portfolio website is intended to showcase my work and skills, making it easier for potential clients or employers to evaluate my capabilities.
