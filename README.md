## Overview 

This portfolio website was built using the React framework and Bootstrap UI. The website includes three pages: Home, Projects, and Contact page. 

- Home page - overviews my skills and experience. It may include a brief bio and some links to other pages and social media profiles.

- Projects page - showcases a sample full-stack project I've made, a project in Java, and a project on NodeJs/Express/React. Each project includes a short description, a demo link, and links to the source code.

- Contact page - allowing visitors to contact me through email. 

Other links on the footer of this portfolio website will go to my LinkedIn Page and internal pages. Overall, the portfolio website is intended to showcase my work and skills, making it easier for potential clients or employers to evaluate my capabilities.
